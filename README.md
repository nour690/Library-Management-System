# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

A simple **Library Management System** developed in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
This project was created by **Mohammad Nour ALTURKMANI** during my **first semester at FSMV University (FSMVU)** — when I knew absolutely nothing about programming.  
It marks the beginning of my journey as a Software Engineering student and my first real project in Java.

## 🎯 Overview

The Library Management System allows a librarian to:
- Add and manage books.
- Register users.
- Borrow and return books.
- Track and display transactions.

It demonstrates the use of **classes, objects, arrays, encapsulation**, and **basic OOP design**.

- **Book** – Represents a book with title, author, and available copies.
- **User** – Represents a library member who can borrow up to three books.
- **Transaction** – Records each borrow or return action.
